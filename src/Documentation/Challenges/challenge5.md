# Challenge 5

## Do we even remember changes?

We are successfully orchestrating our **deterministic** build from NUKE and we have shown that we can fingerprint an assembly.
Now let's connect these steps to identify each fingerprint change and store these  into an identification database.

#### Task: Fingerprint each assembly and write new fingerprints into a storage for later use

_Hint: Use the simplest fingerprinting mechanism for now_
