# Challenge 3 

## Are builds consistent?

We now know how to identify changes in case the assembly differs after a recompile. But, are these changes actually valid?  
As in, how trust worthy is thing fingerprinting mechanism really?

**Task:** Check if fingerprinting holds up to the test of a recompile without a change.
