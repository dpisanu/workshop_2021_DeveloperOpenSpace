# Challenge 8

## Reacting to change.

It is not enough to **only** map out the Fingerprint signatures of the dependencies though. Changes do not only happen down the Dependency Graph of a Test assembly but also in the assembly itself.

#### Task: Extend the challenge 7 solution to also account for Test assembly changes and create a list of assemblies ready for testing.
